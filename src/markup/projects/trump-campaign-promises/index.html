            Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign. Our team wanted to create a way to show exactly how much of his promises he ended up keeping.

            Library Management
          </h1>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            This project made use of two libraries: <a href="https://desandro.com/#isotope">Isotope</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a>. They are relatively hefty libraries, so we needed to make sure users only downloaded what they needed and when they needed it.
          </p>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            So, I made sure to only load in those libraries once this page was loaded.

            How it works
          </h1>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            Editors kept track of the state of promises and updated them accordingly. Users could filter the promises by category, status, and how recently updated they were.
          </p>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            Isotope powered the filtering and sorting, and I used D3 to draw a pie chart showing the status of all promises at a glance.

            Design Execution
          </h1>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            User experience was key to making this work. However, I was only given designs for desktop, and this needed to work for all devices.
          </p>

          <p class="project_section-paragraph margin-top-40">
            So, the design decisions made on mobile were all made by me. Using the design language already established in the desktop mockups, I made sure to keep the page hierarchy in a way that made sense for mobile.

          <p class="project_section-paragraph text_align-left margin-top-40">
            I learned to only load in what I needed, and to use the skills I had to get the job done. I have been given desktop designs and have created mobile designs from them many times, and a task like this is perfectly suited for my skillset.
